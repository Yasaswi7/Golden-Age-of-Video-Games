In this project, I have analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for top 400 video games released since 1977. 
The goal was to find the golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked the best and to explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data. 
I have joined datasets and compared results with set theory along with filtering , grouping and ordering the data.![image](https://github.com/Yasaswi7/Golden-Age-of-Video-Games/assets/45798041/c3f5c343-4335-4847-8e71-0c2053d52e31)
